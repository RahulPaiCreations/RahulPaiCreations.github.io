        Hi, I'm Rahul Pai. I am an Engineering student at the University of
        Cambridge. On this website I show various projects I have done in my own
        time. My career interests are in software development and Blender is a
        hobby of mine. Most of my experience is in Python, which I used for WAV
        Randomiser and the StumPi interface. I have also used C# in Unity 3D,
        Java for Android app development and C++ for various coursework projects
        at Uni.
