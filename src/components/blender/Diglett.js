                . I spent most of the time on the rock part, which I textured
                using a normal rock texture. what made it interesting is that I
                used the HSB node to make it look how I wanted, as it was
                originally just sandstone. I also played with the displacement
                to make it not too sharp and not too smooth. Hope you like it!
